## 🆕 What's New in v2.7.0
* ✅ **Migrated from Poe to OpenRouter**: The bot now calls the OpenRouter API (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`) instead of Poe. The endpoint is OpenAI-compatible, so response parsing and cost tracking are unchanged. Required `HTTP-Referer` and `X-Title` headers are now sent. The config key is `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (the old `POE_API_KEY` still works as a fallback for backward compatibility).
* ✅ **Default Model — MiniMax-M3**: The example config ships with `minimax/minimax-m3` as the default `MAIN_MODEL` and `TRANSLATION_MODEL` ($0.30 in / $1.20 out per 1M tokens). Any OpenRouter model slug works (`openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`, etc.).

## 🆕 What's New in v2.6.1
* ✅ **Fix — End-of-season false positive**: `is_match_today()` no longer broadcasts a misleading "API football is unavailable" message when the API returns `200 OK` with an empty `response` array (typical case during the off-season, when no upcoming match is scheduled). The function now distinguishes a real API failure (5xx, timeout, network error) from a successful API call with no match planned, and only notifies users in the former case. During the off-season, the bot stays silent (logs only).

## 🆕 What's New in v2.6.0
* ✅ **Season Stats in AI Context**: The current-season record of the followed team (in the league of the day's match) is now injected — in a compact one-liner — into both the pre-match (compomatch) and post-match (endmatch) LLM prompts. The LLM finally knows the team's W/D/L, goals for/against, clean sheets, and 5-match form within that specific competition.
* ✅ **Single API Call per Match for Season Stats**: The `/teams/statistics` endpoint is called once before the kickoff and the response is cached in memory for the rest of the match (pre-match prompt + post-match prompt + post-match display block). Total cost: **+1 api-football request per match**.
* ✅ **Optimized Live Polling Budget**: Live polling target lowered from 90 to 85 polls per match, freeing room for the new season-stats call while staying well under the 100 req/day free quota.
* ✅ **Visible Season Stats Block in Telegram & Discord**: After the AI end-of-match analysis, a compact stats panel is appended to the message (record, goals, clean sheets, recent form with 🟢⚪🔴 emojis). Fully compatible with Telegram (`parse_mode=Markdown`) and Discord.
* ✅ **Removed Hard-Coded League IDs**: The previous `if current_league_id == X / Y / Z` chain in the live-polling loop has been replaced by a configurable `[LEAGUE_TYPES]` section in `config.ini`. Any league ID listed in `LEAGUES_WITH_EXTRA_TIME` is treated as potentially going to extra time (+30 min budget). Leagues not listed are treated as regular championships. **The source code is now fully agnostic to country / league / team.**
* ✅ **Public-Repo Hygiene**: Added `.gitignore` (excludes `config.ini`, generated JSON, logs, virtualenv, OS files) and a `config.ini.example` template with neutral placeholders, so the repository can be published without leaking API keys or local data.
* ✅ **Default Model Updated**: The example config previously shipped with `Gemini-3-Flash` as the default `MAIN_MODEL` and `TRANSLATION_MODEL`. As of v2.7.0 the default is the OpenRouter slug `minimax/minimax-m3`.

## 🆕 What's New in v2.5.0
* ✅ **Professional Logging**: Rotating log files with automatic cleanup
* ✅ **Cost Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of AI API costs with detailed summaries
* ✅ **Match History**: Stores last 5 matches for contextual AI analysis
* ✅ **Smart Message Splitting**: Automatically splits long messages for Telegram (4096 chars) and Discord (2000 chars)
* ✅ **API Validation**: Validates all API keys at startup with clear error messages
* ✅ **Improved Reliability**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API calls
* ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and graceful degradation
* ✅ **Poe API Support**: Now supports Poe API with configurable models (Grok-4-Fast-Reasoning, etc.)
* ✅ **Enhanced AI Prompts**: Richer context with match history for better analysis
* ✅ **Missed Penalty Detection**: Smart detection that doesn't notify during penalty shootouts

## 🌟 Potential future updates
* ✅ [DONE] Change of OpenAI's model to use GPT-4o
* ✅ [DONE] Handle the cancellation of goals by VAR
* ✅ [DONE] Professional logging system with rotation
* ✅ [DONE] API cost tracking and monitoring
* ✅ [DONE] Match history for contextual AI analysis
* ✅ [DONE — v2.6.0] Inject current-season team statistics into pre-match and post-match AI prompts (per-league, one API call per match, cached)
* ✅ [DONE — v2.6.0] Make the codebase fully agnostic (no hard-coded league IDs)
* [Low priority] Allow API calls to retrieve the standings once per day, and on match days 1 hour after the match if API calls remain available. Enable users to check standings via Telegram and Discord commands (stored locally to avoid excessive API calls). Incorporate standings data in pre-match and post-match analysis for both free and paid API versions, referencing locally stored standings without making additional API calls. Consider whether to implement this for national championships only or for all competitions.
* [Low priority] Make the bot more flexible by adding more events such as yellow cards and player changes, with the option of enabling or disabling events in `config.ini`. The idea behind the bot was to send only essential messages, so this is not a high priority.
* [Low priority] Implement a better scoring management for penalty shootouts, as they are not handled the same way as regular goals
* [Low priority] Improved handling of season ID retrieval (currently requires manual adjustment in `config.ini` at the beginning of each season)

## ✅ Known Issues - Resolution Status

### **RESOLVED Issues** ✅

* ✅ **[SOLVED]** A bug seems to occur when a new goal is scored but an old goal is updated (for example, in terms of time). The new goal is not sent, but the score is updated, which seems to prevent the sending of the new goal.
  * **Resolution**: Fixed with `event_key_sub` mechanism that prevents duplicate notifications even when API corrects goal timing

* ✅ **[SOLVED]** When a penalty miss occurs, the following goals during a match are not sent under certain conditions
  * **Resolution**: Enhanced penalty miss detection with proper event tracking and continuation logic

* ✅ **[SOLVED]** When a goal is disallowed under certain conditions, no alert is sent to indicate that the goal has been cancelled
  * **Resolution**: Improved VAR goal cancellation detection with proper score comparison and notification

* ✅ **[SOLVED]** [Free API] A bug that seemed to prevent sending a goal if the goal was sent simultaneously with the first event (mainly free API)
  * **Resolution**: Fixed with improved `is_first_event` logic and score update mechanism

* ✅ **[SOLVED]** [Free API] In very rare instances, if two goals are scored in quick succession and there's a delay in API score updates, the score might not be correctly updated until the next goal or the end of the match
  * **Resolution**: Enhanced score tracking with `previous_score` and `current_score` comparison, plus `goal_events` accumulation

* ✅ **[SOLVED — v2.5.1]** Goal timing corrections from API were not reflected in sent messages, causing confusion about when goals were actually scored
  * **Resolution**: Implemented `sent_events_details` tracking system that detects timing changes and automatically sends correction notifications to users

* ✅ **[SOLVED — v2.5.1]** Automatic correction messages now sent when timing changes are detected

* ✅ **[SOLVED — v2.6.0]** League IDs were hard-coded in `check_events()`, making the bot non-portable across countries
  * **Resolution**: Removed all hard-coded IDs. Behavior driven by the optional `[LEAGUE_TYPES]` section in `config.ini` (`LEAGUES_WITH_EXTRA_TIME`).

* ✅ **[SOLVED — v2.6.0]** AI pre-match and post-match analyses had no awareness of the team's current-season form within the specific competition being played
  * **Resolution**: One `/teams/statistics` call is made before kickoff and cached in memory, then reused in `call_chatgpt_api_compomatch` (start-of-match prompt) and `call_chatgpt_api_endmatch` (end-of-match prompt). Compact one-liner format keeps token usage minimal.

* ✅ **[SOLVED — v2.6.1]** During the off-season, the bot was sending a daily false-positive message claiming "API football is unavailable" because `is_match_today()` treated a valid `200 OK` response with an empty `response` array (no upcoming match) the same way as a real API failure
  * **Resolution**: Added an `api_call_succeeded` flag to differentiate "API OK but no fixture scheduled" (silent log only — expected during off-season) from "API actually unreachable" (still broadcast to users). No more daily spam between seasons.

### **Circumvented Issues** 🕹️

* **[🕹️ CIRCUMVENTED — v2.5.1]** [Free API] In very rare instances, a disallowed goal could go undetected if two scored goals were identified — including one that was later disallowed — within the same interval between two checks.
  * **Status**: Mitigated by a dual-layer safety net in the live-event loop: (1) explicit handling of `Var` events with `"Goal Disallowed"` detail (`gptfoot.py:1359-1375`), and (2) a backup score-decrease detector that fires `send_goal_cancelled_message` whenever `current_score < previous_score` (`gptfoot.py:1461-1465`). Residual probability **< 1%**, and even in that residual case the displayed score remains accurate.

* **[🕹️ CIRCUMVENTED]** [Free API] Some events occurring in the very last seconds of a period may not be detected
  * **Status**: Inherent limitation of the free api-football tier — the live-polling interval (~80-100 s) is constrained by the 100 req/day quota and cannot be shortened without exceeding it. The bot is calibrated to maximize coverage (85 polls/match target) while leaving margin for season-stats and lineup calls. **Recommendation**: subscribe to a paid api-football plan and set `IS_PAID_API = true` for full 15 s polling.

* **[🕹️ CIRCUMVENTED]** [Paid API] The script does not update the score with penalty shots as this is handled differently (AI end-of-match analysis partially incorrect on shootouts)
  * **Status**: By design — penalty shootout goals are tracked separately and included in the final match analysis

* **[🕹️ CIRCUMVENTED]** [Paid API] Goals invalidated during a penalty shootout session are not considered
  * **Status**: By design — only successful penalty shootout goals are reported to avoid confusion

## 📋 Good to know
* The bot cannot provide ongoing match information if launched on a server during the match; only upcoming matches are considered
* Log files are automatically rotated when they reach 10 MB, keeping the last 5 backups
* API costs are tracked and summarized at the end of each match (when enabled in `config.ini`)
* Match analyses are stored locally in `match_analyses.json` for contextual AI insights
* Season stats are NOT persisted on disk — they are fetched once per match and cached only in memory for the duration of that match
* [Free API] Due to API call limitations, 5-minute breaks during extra time are considered as regular half-times, causing the script to pause for 13 minutes
* [Free API] Due to API call limitations, during penalty shootout sessions, the script pauses for 20 minutes (good to know but penalty goals are managed differently than goals during a match)
* [Free API] Live-polling interval is computed dynamically based on whether the league is listed in `LEAGUES_WITH_EXTRA_TIME` (longer total budget when extra time is possible). Target = 85 polls per match, leaving margin for `is_match_today`, lineups, and `/teams/statistics` calls under the 100 req/day quota.

## 🚀 Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Macmachi/gptfoot.git
cd gptfoot

# 2. Create your local config from the template
